People with a fear of small holes have claimed the design of Apple's iPhone 11 Pro is triggering their phobia.
 At its unveiling on Tuesday, many found their attention drawn to its "ultra-wide" rear camera, with three high-powered lenses packed closely together.
  The lenses sit alongside the handset's torch and "audio zoom" microphone.
   And hundreds of smartphone users now claim the new design has triggered their "trypophobia", an aversion to the sight of clusters of small holes.
    Apple did not think of us that have TRYPOPHOBIA when making the iphone 11 pro.
     I cant buy it and be itchy all over every damn time I look at it.
      The term "trypophobia" was first coined in 2005 in online forum Reddit and it has since become widely talked about on social media.
       American Horror Story actress Sarah Paulson and model Kendall Jenner are among those who say they have the condition.
        Vision scientist Dr Geoff Cole, at the University of Essex, was part of the first full scientific study of trypophobia, working with his colleague, Prof Arnold Wilkins.
